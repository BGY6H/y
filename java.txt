### **How This Helps:**
- Each comment explains **why** a line of code is there, which will make it easier for students with no prior programming experience to follow along.
- The use of **clear and simple explanations** will help students understand the functionality of each part without feeling overwhelmed.
  
Let me know if you'd like to add more features or have further questions! ðŸ˜Š

### **Features Implemented**
1. **User-Friendly Navigation**: The app uses buttons and grids, making it easy for users to navigate between the main screen and the categories screen.
2. **Intuitive Menu**: The categories are displayed in a grid layout, which is commonly used for e-commerce apps to allow users to easily browse through product categories.
3. **Easy Browsing**: By using a simple grid layout for categories, the app makes it easy for users to find what theyâ€™re looking for without unnecessary complexity.

### **What to Add Next**
- **Product Listings**: After clicking a category, you can display products specific to that category.
- **Details Screen**: Add product detail pages where users can see more information about each product.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Implement a shopping cart to allow users to add products and proceed to checkout.
- **User Authentication**: Add login and registration functionality to handle user accounts.
  
This basic structure is easy to extend and scale for more complex features. You can make the layout more advanced by customizing each screen further with images, buttons, and more intricate navigation logic.

Let me know if you'd like further guidance on extending this app! ðŸ˜Š
