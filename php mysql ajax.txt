}

// Process the credit card payment request (AJAX POST request)
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['credit_card_payment'])) {
    // Capture form input
    $card_number = $_POST['card_number']; // Card number from the user
    $card_expiry = $_POST['card_expiry']; // Expiry date in MM/YY
    $card_cvv = $_POST['card_cvv'];       // Card CVV code
    $amount = $_POST['amount'];           // Payment amount
    
    // Validate the card details (basic validation)
    if (strlen($card_number) !== 16 || strlen($card_cvv) !== 3) {
        echo json_encode(['status' => 'error', 'message' => 'Invalid card details']);
        exit;
    }

    // Simulate payment gateway processing
    $payment_status = "Success"; // Mock response (Success or Failure)
    
    // Save the transaction in the database
    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO transactions (payment_method, amount, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
    $stmt->bind_param("sis", $method, $amount, $payment_status);
    $method = "Credit/Debit Card";
    $stmt->execute();
