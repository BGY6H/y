Below is PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript code for implementing **Payment Confirmation Emails** and **Multi-Currency Support**. Each line of code includes comments beside it for clarity.

---

### **1. Payment Confirmation Emails**
We will use the `PHPMailer` library to send confirmation emails after a successful payment. Install it using Composer if it's not already installed (`composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`).

```php
<?php
// Include PHPMailer library
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer; // Load PHPMailer class
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception; // Load Exception class for error handling

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Load Composer dependencies

// Connect to the database to fetch payment details
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database"); // Database connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error); // Check database connection
}

// Retrieve payment details from the database
$order_id = $_GET['order_id']; // Get order ID from the request (ensure proper validation/sanitization)
$query = "SELECT * FROM payments WHERE order_id = '$order_id'"; // Query to fetch payment details
$result = $conn->query($query); // Execute query
if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    $paymentDetails = $result->fetch_assoc(); // Fetch payment data
    $email = $paymentDetails['email']; // Get customer email
    $amount = $paymentDetails['amount']; // Get payment amount
    $transaction_id = $paymentDetails['transaction_id']; // Get transaction ID

    // Initialize PHPMailer
    $mail = new PHPMailer(true); // Create PHPMailer instance
    try {
        // SMTP server settings
        $mail->isSMTP(); // Set email protocol to SMTP
        $mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com'; // Specify SMTP server
        $mail->SMTPAuth = true; // Enable SMTP authentication
        $mail->Username = 'your_email@example.com'; // SMTP username
        $mail->Password = 'your_password'; // SMTP password
        $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS; // Enable TLS encryption
        $mail->Port = 587; // TCP port for connecting to SMTP

        // Email content
        $mail->setFrom('your_email@example.com', 'Your Business Name'); // Set sender email and name
        $mail->addAddress($email); // Add recipient email
        $mail->isHTML(true); // Set email format to HTML
        $mail->Subject = 'Payment Confirmation'; // Email subject
        $mail->Body = "Dear Customer,<br><br>Thank you for your payment!<br>Transaction ID: $transaction_id<br>Order ID: $order_id<br>Amount: $$amount<br><br>We appreciate your business!"; // Email body with details

        // Send email
        $mail->send(); // Trigger email sending
        echo "Payment confirmation email sent successfully."; // Success message
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo "Error sending email: {$mail->ErrorInfo}"; // Error message if email fails
    }
} else {
    echo "Payment details not found."; // Error if no payment record exists
}

$conn->close(); // Close database connection
?>
```

---

### **2. Multi-Currency Support**
Here, we use the Open Exchange Rates API to fetch real-time exchange rates. You need an API key to access their service.

```php
<?php
// Fetch user location via IP
$user_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; // Get client IP address
$location_data = file_get_contents("http://ip-api.com/json/$user_ip"); // Use IP API to fetch location details
$location = json_decode($location_data, true); // Decode JSON response
$country_code = $location['countryCode']; // Extract country code

// Set default currency and rates API
$default_currency = 'USD'; // Default currency for pricing
$api_url = 'https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json'; // Open Exchange Rates API URL
$api_key = 'your_api_key_here'; // Replace with your API key

// Fetch real-time exchange rates
$exchange_data = file_get_contents("$api_url?app_id=$api_key"); // Fetch exchange rates
$rates = json_decode($exchange_data, true)['rates']; // Decode JSON and extract rates

// Convert price based on location
$currency = isset($rates[$country_code]) ? $country_code : $default_currency; // Determine local currency
$product_price_usd = 100; // Example price in USD
$converted_price = $product_price_usd * $rates[$currency]; // Convert price using exchange rate

// Display converted price to user
echo "Price in $currency: " . number_format($converted_price, 2); // Output converted price
?>
```

**Frontend Example (JavaScript):**
```javascript
// Detect user's location and currency (client-side, optional)
fetch("http://ip-api.com/json") // Use IP API to fetch location
    .then(response => response.json()) // Parse JSON response
    .then(data => {
        console.log("Your country:", data.country); // Log user's country
        console.log("Currency conversion may apply."); // Indicate currency adjustments
    })
    .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching location:", error)); // Handle errors
```

Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments
Description: Enable subscriptions or recurring billing for services like SaaS or membershipbased services
Example Feature: Integrate with services like Stripe or PayPal for recurring payments

Coupon and Discount Codes
Description: Allow users to apply promotional codes during the checkout process to get discounts on their orders
Example Feature: Create a promo code system in the database and apply discounts to total payments


Below are the PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript snippets for the **Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments** and **Coupon and Discount Codes** features, along with comments beside each line of code for clarity.

### **Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments**

This example assumes integration with **Stripe** for subscription management:

#### **PHP (Backend - `subscription.php`)**
```php
<?php
// Include Stripe PHP library (make sure to install it using Composer)
require 'vendor/autoload.php';  // Include Stripe library

\Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('your_stripe_secret_key');  // Set your Stripe secret key

// Get the user's data from the request
$token = $_POST['stripeToken'];  // Get the token generated by Stripe.js (from frontend)
$email = $_POST['email'];  // Get user email

// Create the customer in Stripe
$customer = \Stripe\Customer::create([  // Create a new Stripe customer
    'email' => $email,  // User's email
    'source' => $token   // Token representing the user's payment method
]);

// Create a subscription for the customer
$subscription = \Stripe\Subscription::create([  // Create a new subscription
    'customer' => $customer->id,  // Customer ID
    'items' => [['plan' => 'your_plan_id']],  // Specify the plan ID to subscribe to
    'expand' => ['latest_invoice.payment_intent']  // Expand to include payment intent details
]);

// Handle the payment and subscription status
if ($subscription->status == 'active') {  // If subscription is successfully activated
    echo 'Subscription successful';  // Success message
} else {
    echo 'Subscription failed';  // Error message if the subscription fails
}
?>
```

#### **MySQL (Database Schema for Subscription)**

```sql
-- Create a table to store subscription details for users
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Subscription ID (primary key)
    user_id INT NOT NULL,  -- User ID who is subscribing
    stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255),  -- Stripe Customer ID
    stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),  -- Stripe Subscription ID
    status ENUM('active', 'canceled', 'failed') DEFAULT 'active',  -- Subscription status
    start_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- Date when subscription started
    end_date TIMESTAMP NULL  -- Optional: end date for the subscription (if applicable)
);
```

#### **JavaScript (Frontend - Using Stripe.js)**

```html
<!-- Include Stripe.js on the frontend -->
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>

<script>
// Set your Stripe public key
var stripe = Stripe('your_stripe_public_key');  // Stripe public key

// Handle the form submission
var form = document.getElementById('subscription-form');  // Get the subscription form
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();  // Prevent form submission

    // Create a Stripe token from the payment method details
    stripe.createToken('card', card).then(function(result) {  // Replace `card` with your card element
        if (result.error) {
            console.log(result.error.message);  // Log any errors
        } else {
            // Send the token to your server for subscription processing
            var token = result.token.id;  // Get the token ID
            var email = document.getElementById('email').value;  // Get user email
            fetch('/subscription.php', {
                method: 'POST',
                body: JSON.stringify({ stripeToken: token, email: email }),  // Send token and email to the backend
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data));
        }
    });
});
</script>
```

---

### **Coupon and Discount Codes**

This example assumes a basic coupon system in the database that applies a discount to the total payment amount.

#### **PHP (Backend - `apply_coupon.php`)**
```php
<?php
// Database connection
$host = 'localhost';  // Database host
$dbname = 'your_database';  // Database name
$username = 'your_username';  // Database username
$password = 'your_password';  // Database password
$conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname", $username, $password);  // Establish database connection

// Get the coupon code and user ID from POST
$coupon_code = $_POST['coupon_code'];  // Coupon code entered by the user
$user_id = $_POST['user_id'];  // User ID

// Query to check if the coupon exists and is valid
$query = "SELECT * FROM coupons WHERE code = :coupon_code AND status = 'active'";  // Check coupon status
$stmt = $conn->prepare($query);  // Prepare the SQL query
$stmt->bindParam(':coupon_code', $coupon_code);  // Bind the coupon code parameter
$stmt->execute();  // Execute the query

// Check if the coupon is valid
if ($stmt->rowCount() > 0) {
    $coupon = $stmt->fetch();  // Fetch coupon data
    $discount = $coupon['discount_amount'];  // Get the discount amount from the coupon

    // Apply the discount to the user's total amount
    $total_amount = $_POST['total_amount'];  // Total amount before discount
    $new_total = $total_amount - $discount;  // Calculate the new total

    // Return the new total amount after discount
    echo json_encode(['new_total' => $new_total, 'success' => true]);
} else {
    // If the coupon is invalid or expired
    echo json_encode(['error' => 'Invalid or expired coupon', 'success' => false]);
}
?>
```

#### **MySQL (Database Schema for Coupons)**

```sql
-- Create a table for storing coupon codes
CREATE TABLE coupons (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Coupon ID (primary key)
    code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- Coupon code (unique)
    discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Discount amount (e.g., $10 off)
    status ENUM('active', 'expired', 'used') DEFAULT 'active',  -- Coupon status
    expiration_date DATE NULL  -- Optional: expiration date for the coupon
);
```

#### **JavaScript (Frontend - Apply Coupon)**

```html
<!-- Coupon code input field and apply button -->
<input type="text" id="coupon_code" placeholder="Enter coupon code">
<button id="apply_coupon">Apply Coupon</button>

<script>
// Listen for coupon application
document.getElementById('apply_coupon').addEventListener('click', function() {
    var coupon_code = document.getElementById('coupon_code').value;  // Get the entered coupon code
    var user_id = 'user123';  // Example user ID
    var total_amount = 100;  // Example total amount

    // Send the coupon code and total amount to the server
    fetch('/apply_coupon.php', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ coupon_code: coupon_code, user_id: user_id, total_amount: total_amount }),
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            // Update the total with the new discounted amount
            alert('Coupon applied! New total: $' + data.new_total);
        } else {
            // Show error message if coupon is invalid
            alert(data.error);
        }
    });
});
</script>
```

### Summary:

1. **Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments**:
   - Integrate with Stripe (or other services like PayPal).
   - Handle customer creation, subscription creation, and status checking.
   - Use JavaScript (Stripe.js) for tokenizing credit card data securely.

2. **Coupon and Discount Codes**:
   - Store coupon codes in a MySQL table with discount values and expiration dates.
   - Allow users to apply coupons at checkout and update their total amount accordingly.

These examples provide a basic foundation for both features, and can be extended with more advanced error handling, user authentication, and other necessary business logic.


To test the **Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments** and **Coupon and Discount Codes** features you've developed, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up a Local Development Environment:**
   First, make sure you have a local development environment where you can run and test PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. If you haven't already:
   
   - **Install XAMPP/WAMP**: These tools include PHP, MySQL, and Apache in a single package, making it easier to set up your environment.
     - **Download XAMPP**: [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
     - **Download WAMP**: [https://www.wampserver.com/en/](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
   
   - **Install Composer**: If you are using Stripe, make sure to install Composer for dependency management.
     - [Download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### 2. **Setting Up MySQL Database:**
   - Launch **phpMyAdmin** via XAMPP/WAMP or connect directly to MySQL.
   - Create a database for your application and add the tables required for **subscriptions** and **coupons**.
   - Run the following SQL commands to create the required tables for coupons and subscriptions:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT NOT NULL,
       stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255),
       stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),
       status ENUM('active', 'canceled', 'failed') DEFAULT 'active',
       start_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       end_date TIMESTAMP NULL
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE coupons (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
       status ENUM('active', 'expired', 'used') DEFAULT 'active',
       expiration_date DATE NULL
   );
   ```

### 3. **Test Recurring Billing / Subscription Payments**:

   To test the subscription functionality with **Stripe**:
   - **Sign Up for Stripe**: Create a **Stripe** account if you haven't already.
     - [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
   
   - **Stripe Test Keys**: Make sure to use the **Test API keys** provided by Stripe (these allow you to simulate payments without actually charging real money).
     - Get the API keys: [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys)
   
   - **Configure Stripe in Your Code**: Insert your **Stripe secret key** and **public key** into the PHP and JavaScript code where appropriate.

   - **Test Subscription Flow**:
     - Use the **Stripe test card numbers** (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiry date and CVC) to test subscription creation in your form.
     - Run the backend PHP script (`subscription.php`) to check if the customer is created successfully in Stripe and subscribed to the correct plan.

### 4. **Test Coupon and Discount Codes**:

   - **Test Coupon System**:
     - Insert some sample coupons into your database manually or via an admin interface. Example coupon:
       ```sql
       INSERT INTO coupons (code, discount_amount, status, expiration_date)
       VALUES ('SAVE10', 10, 'active', '2024-12-31');
       ```
     - Then, use the **apply_coupon.php** script to simulate applying a coupon code during checkout. Check if the discount is applied correctly to the total.

### 5. **Test the Frontend**:
   - Open your HTML page in a browser, where users can input coupon codes and submit subscription forms.
   - For **coupon testing**, try entering valid and invalid coupon codes to check how the discount is applied or rejected.
   - For **Stripe testing**, check that when a user enters credit card information (via Stripe.js), it correctly sends a token to the backend and processes the subscription.
   
### 6. **Testing in Live Environment** (Optional):
   - Once you've confirmed everything is working in your local development environment, test the application in a **staging** environment using **live keys** from Stripe or PayPal.
   - Make sure to **disable test mode** and use real payment methods in your live environment, ensuring to test all payment flows.

### 7. **Check Responses and Logs**:
   - Log any errors or responses (e.g., from the API or database operations) to ensure your system handles failures or edge cases.
   - Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript issues, and check the server logs for PHP or MySQL-related errors.

---

By following these steps, you can test the **subscription payments** and **coupon application** features locally before pushing them to a live environment. This will ensure that the functionality works smoothly and the user experience is correct.

How to Implement These Features

Payment Gateway Integrations: For features like credit card payments, wallets, and BNPL, youâ€™ll need to integrate thirdparty services such as Stripe, PayPal, Klarna, and others Each of these services typically offers an API that you can use to process payments securely

Email Notifications: Use PHP libraries such as PHPMailer to send emails when a transaction is completed These emails can include order confirmations and payment receipts

Recurring Payments: Use subscription services like Stripe Billing or PayPal Recurring Payments for managing subscriptionbased businesses

Fraud Detection: Integrate services like D Secure or thirdparty fraud detection APIs to minimize the risk of chargebacks and fraudulent activities

Tax Calculation APIs: For automatic tax calculations, you can integrate APIs like TaxJar, Avalara, or use builtin tax tools in payment gateways like Stripe
