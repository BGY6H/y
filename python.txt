// Check connection
if ($mysqli->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $mysqli->connect_error);
}

// Process the credit card payment request (AJAX POST request)
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['credit_card_payment'])) {
    // Capture form input
    $card_number = $_POST['card_number']; // Card number from the user
    $card_expiry = $_POST['card_expiry']; // Expiry date in MM/YY
    $card_cvv = $_POST['card_cvv'];       // Card CVV code
    $amount = $_POST['amount'];           // Payment amount
    
    // Validate the card details (basic validation)
    if (strlen($card_number) !== 16 || strlen($card_cvv) !== 3) {
        echo json_encode(['status' => 'error', 'message' => 'Invalid card details']);
        exit;
    }

    // Simulate payment gateway processing
    $payment_status = "Success"; // Mock response (Success or Failure)
    
    // Save the transaction in the database
    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO transactions (payment_method, amount, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
    $stmt->bind_param("sis", $method, $amount, $payment_status);
    $method = "Credit/Debit Card";
    $stmt->execute();

These comments explain the steps involved in handling payments via Credit/Debit cards, Digital Wallets, Buy Now Pay Later options, and Bank Transfers. Let me know if you'd like further details on any specific part of the code or additional features!
______________________
---

This code covers the back-end (PHP/MySQL) and front-end (AJAX) for all the requested payment features. Let me know if you need assistance setting up or testing any of these!
Testing these features and setting them up involves several steps, covering **server setup**, **database creation**, **code integration**, and **testing the workflow**. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up and test each feature:

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**
1. **Install a Local Server Environment**:
   - Use tools like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) to run PHP and MySQL on your local machine.
   - Alternatively, use a live server or a cloud environment if preferred (e.g., AWS, Linode).

2. **Install MySQL**:
   - MySQL comes pre-installed with XAMPP/MAMP. Ensure you can access **phpMyAdmin** or any MySQL client.

3. **Set Up a Text Editor/IDE**:
   - Use editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or PHPStorm for writing code.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Database and Tables**
1. **Create the Database**:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (or your MySQL client).
   - Run this SQL command to create the `ecommerce_db` database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
     ```

2. **Create the Transactions Table**:
   - Inside `ecommerce_db`, create a `transactions` table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE transactions (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         payment_method VARCHAR(50),
         amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
         status VARCHAR(20),
         transaction_id VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );
     ```

---

### **Step 3: Configure PHP**
1. **Database Connection**:
   - Create a `db.php` file to centralize your database connection:
     ```php
     <?php
     $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "ecommerce_db");
     
     // Check connection
     if ($mysqli->connect_error) {
         die("Connection failed: " . $mysqli->connect_error);
     }
     ?>
     ```

2. **Payment Handler File**:
   - Save the provided PHP code in a file, e.g., `payment_handler.php`.
   - Include the `db.php` connection:
     ```php
     require_once 'db.php';
     ```

3. **Form for Testing**:
   - Create a simple HTML form for each payment type and integrate the AJAX code provided. For example:

---

### **Step 4: HTML Forms for Testing**

#### **Form for Credit/Debit Card Payments**
```html
<form id="creditCardForm">
    <h3>Credit/Debit Card Payment</h3>
    <input type="text" id="card_number" placeholder="Card Number" required><br>
    <input type="text" id="card_expiry" placeholder="Expiry (MM/YY)" required><br>
    <input type="text" id="card_cvv" placeholder="CVV" required><br>
    <input type="number" id="amount" placeholder="Amount" required><br>
    <button type="button" id="payButton">Pay Now</button>
</form>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Add the AJAX script for credit card payments here
</script>
```

#### **Form for Digital Wallets**
```html
<form id="digitalWalletForm">
    <h3>Digital Wallet Payment</h3>
    <select id="wallet_type">
        <option value="Apple Pay">Apple Pay</option>
        <option value="Google Pay">Google Pay</option>
        <option value="Samsung Pay">Samsung Pay</option>
    </select><br>
    <input type="number" id="amount" placeholder="Amount" required><br>
    <button type="button" id="walletPayButton">Pay with Wallet</button>
</form>
<script>
    // Add the AJAX script for digital wallet payments here
</script>
```

#### **Form for Bank Transfer**
```html
<form id="bankTransferForm">
    <h3>Bank Transfer Payment</h3>
    <input type="text" id="bank_name" placeholder="Bank Name" required><br>
    <input type="text" id="transaction_id" placeholder="Transaction ID" required><br>
    <input type="number" id="amount" placeholder="Amount" required><br>
    <button type="button" id="bankTransferButton">Submit Bank Transfer</button>
</form>
<script>
    // Add the AJAX script for bank transfer here
</script>
```

#### **Form for Buy Now, Pay Later**
```html
<form id="bnplForm">
    <h3>Buy Now, Pay Later</h3>
    <select id="provider">
        <option value="Afterpay">Afterpay</option>
        <option value="Klarna">Klarna</option>
    </select><br>
    <input type="number" id="amount" placeholder="Amount" required><br>
    <button type="button" id="bnplButton">Proceed with BNPL</button>
</form>
<script>
    // Add the AJAX script for Buy Now, Pay Later here
</script>
```

---

### **Step 5: Test the Features**
1. **Launch Local Server**:
   - Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP/MAMP.

2. **Access the Forms**:
   - Save the HTML forms (e.g., `index.html`) in the root folder of your local server (`htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Open the file in your browser: `http://localhost/index.html`.

3. **Submit Test Data**:
   - Fill out the forms and click the buttons. The AJAX will send the data to `payment_handler.php`.

4. **Check Results**:
   - Open `phpMyAdmin`, go to the `transactions` table in the `ecommerce_db` database, and verify that transactions are being logged.

---

### **Step 6: Debugging**
- **Enable PHP Errors**:
   Add the following lines at the top of `payment_handler.php` for debugging:
   ```php
   ini_set('display_errors', 1);
   ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1);
   error_reporting(E_ALL);
   ```

- **Inspect AJAX Responses**:
   Use browser developer tools (`F12`) to monitor network requests and check if the responses are correct.

---

### **Step 7: Deployment**
Once tested locally:
1. **Migrate to a Live Server**:
   - Transfer the files and database to your production environment.
   - Update the `db.php` file with live database credentials.

2. **Secure Payment Integration**:
   - Replace the mocked payment responses with real payment gateway APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
   - Always ensure **PCI compliance** for handling sensitive card data.
