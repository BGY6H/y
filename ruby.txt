please give me ruby code for `if`, `elsif`, `else` – Conditional statements for branching logic. put a comment beside each line of code without skipping. some of my students have no prior programming concepts whatsoever 

Sure! Below is an example of Ruby code that demonstrates how to use `if`, `elsif`, and `else` for conditional statements, with comments beside each line explaining the logic:

### **Ruby Code for Conditional Statements (`if`, `elsif`, `else`)**

```ruby
age = 25  # Set the variable `age` to 25

if age >= 18  # Check if `age` is greater than or equal to 18
  puts "You are an adult."  # If the condition is true (age >= 18), this message will be printed
elsif age >= 13  # If the first condition is false, check if `age` is greater than or equal to 13
  puts "You are a teenager."  # If the condition is true (age >= 13), this message will be printed
else  # If none of the above conditions are true (age < 13), the `else` block will run
  puts "You are a child."  # If `age` is less than 13, this message will be printed
end  # End of the conditional block
```

### **Explanation of the Code:**

- **`age = 25`**: This line assigns the value `25` to the variable `age`. This is the value that will be evaluated in the conditional statements.
  
- **`if age >= 18`**: The `if` statement checks whether `age` is greater than or equal to `18`. If this condition is true, it will execute the code inside the `if` block (`puts "You are an adult."`).

- **`puts "You are an adult."`**: If the condition `age >= 18` is true, this line will print the message "You are an adult."

- **`elsif age >= 13`**: If the `if` condition (`age >= 18`) is false, the `elsif` (else if) condition is checked. It checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `13`. If this condition is true, it will execute the code inside the `elsif` block (`puts "You are a teenager."`).

- **`puts "You are a teenager."`**: If the `elsif` condition (`age >= 13`) is true, this line will print the message "You are a teenager."

- **`else`**: The `else` block is executed if neither the `if` nor the `elsif` conditions are true. It serves as the default case when no previous conditions were met.

- **`puts "You are a child."`**: If `age` is less than 13, this line will print "You are a child."

- **`end`**: This marks the end of the conditional block. It indicates that the `if`-`elsif`-`else` statements are finished.

### **What happens when the code runs?**
Given that `age = 25`, the condition `age >= 18` is true, so the output will be:

```
You are an adult.
```

If you change the `age` value, different messages will be printed based on the conditions.

### **Examples with Different `age` Values:**
1. **If `age = 25`:**
   - Output: `"You are an adult."`
   
2. **If `age = 15`:**
   - Output: `"You are a teenager."`
   
3. **If `age = 10`:**
   - Output: `"You are a child."`

### **Summary of Conditional Statements:**
- **`if`**: Used to check a condition. If the condition is true, it runs the code block inside it.
- **`elsif`**: Used to check additional conditions if the previous `if` or `elsif` conditions were false.
- **`else`**: Used as a default when all previous conditions are false.

please give me ruby code for `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor` – Define getter/setter methods for instance variables. put a comment beside each line of code without skipping. some of my students have no prior programming concepts whatsoever 

Here’s a breakdown of how `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` work in Ruby, with comments beside each line of code to explain them in simple terms.

### 1. **`attr_reader`** - Defines a getter method for an instance variable

```ruby
class Product
  attr_reader :name  # Automatically creates a getter method for the `@name` instance variable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name  # The instance variable `@name` is set in the initialize method
  end
end

product = Product.new("Laptop")  # Creating a new Product object with "Laptop" as the name
puts product.name  # Accesses the `@name` variable using the automatically created getter
```

#### Explanation:
- `attr_reader :name` creates a method called `name` that returns the value of the `@name` instance variable.
- When you call `product.name`, it will return `"Laptop"` without needing to write a separate method to do this.

---

### 2. **`attr_writer`** - Defines a setter method for an instance variable

```ruby
class Product
  attr_writer :price  # Automatically creates a setter method for the `@price` instance variable

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price  # The instance variable `@price` is set in the initialize method
  end
end

product = Product.new(1000)  # Creating a new Product object with 1000 as the price
product.price = 1200  # Sets the `@price` variable to 1200 using the automatically created setter
```

#### Explanation:
- `attr_writer :price` creates a method called `price=` that sets the value of the `@price` instance variable.
- When you call `product.price = 1200`, it updates the value of `@price` to `1200`.

---

### 3. **`attr_accessor`** - Defines both getter and setter methods for an instance variable

```ruby
class Product
  attr_accessor :stock  # Automatically creates both getter and setter methods for the `@stock` instance variable

  def initialize(stock)
    @stock = stock  # The instance variable `@stock` is set in the initialize method
  end
end

product = Product.new(50)  # Creating a new Product object with 50 as the initial stock
puts product.stock  # Accesses the `@stock` variable using the getter method
product.stock = 100  # Updates the `@stock` variable using the setter method
puts product.stock  # Accesses the updated value of `@stock`, which is now 100
```

#### Explanation:
- `attr_accessor :stock` creates two methods: one to get the value of `@stock` (`stock`) and one to set it (`stock=`).
- This means you can both access and modify the `@stock` variable directly without needing to write custom getter and setter methods.

---

### **Summary of Differences**:
- `attr_reader` generates a **getter** method, allowing you to **read** the value of an instance variable.
- `attr_writer` generates a **setter** method, allowing you to **write** or **modify** the value of an instance variable.
- `attr_accessor` generates both a **getter** and a **setter** method, allowing both **read** and **write** access to the instance variable.

These shorthand methods help make your code cleaner and more concise by automatically defining what would otherwise be repetitive getter and setter methods.

please give me ruby code for Methods – Functions defined within a class (`def my_method`). put a comment beside each line of code without skipping. some of my students have no prior programming concepts whatsoever 

Certainly! Here's an example of Ruby code that demonstrates how to define methods within a class using the `def` keyword. I'll include comments beside each line to explain it in simple terms for beginners.

### **Ruby Class with Methods**

```ruby
class Car  # Define a class called `Car`
  
  def initialize(make, model)  # Define a special method called `initialize` that runs when a new object is created
    @make = make  # Set the `@make` instance variable to the value passed to `make`
    @model = model  # Set the `@model` instance variable to the value passed to `model`
  end
  
  def display_info  # Define a method called `display_info`
    puts "Car Make: #{@make}, Model: #{@model}"  # Prints the make and model of the car using instance variables
  end
  
  def start_engine  # Define a method called `start_engine`
    puts "The engine is now running."  # Prints a message indicating that the car's engine is running
  end
  
  def stop_engine  # Define a method called `stop_engine`
    puts "The engine has been turned off."  # Prints a message indicating that the car's engine is off
  end
  
end  # End of the Car class

# Create an object (instance) of the `Car` class
my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")  # Create a new `Car` object, passing "Toyota" and "Camry" to the initialize method

my_car.display_info  # Call the `display_info` method on `my_car` to display the car's information
my_car.start_engine  # Call the `start_engine` method on `my_car` to simulate starting the engine
my_car.stop_engine  # Call the `stop_engine` method on `my_car` to simulate stopping the engine
```

### **Explanation**:

- **`class Car`**: Defines a class called `Car`. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects (like a car).
  
- **`def initialize(make, model)`**: This is a special method called the `initialize` method. It's automatically called when a new instance of the `Car` class is created. It accepts two parameters (`make` and `model`) and assigns them to instance variables (`@make` and `@model`). 

- **`@make` and `@model`**: These are instance variables. They store the data specific to each object (like the make and model of a car). The `@` symbol is used to denote instance variables.

- **`def display_info`**: This defines a regular method called `display_info`. Inside this method, we use `puts` to print the car's make and model to the screen. The `@make` and `@model` variables are accessed here.

- **`def start_engine` and `def stop_engine`**: These are additional methods that print messages when called, simulating the starting and stopping of a car's engine.

- **`my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")`**: This creates a new object of the `Car` class, passing `"Toyota"` and `"Camry"` as arguments to the `initialize` method.

- **`my_car.display_info`**: This calls the `display_info` method on the `my_car` object, which displays the car's make and model.

- **Calling Other Methods**: Similarly, calling `my_car.start_engine` and `my_car.stop_engine` simulates the behavior of starting and stopping the car's engine.

### **What happens when the code runs?**
1. The `Car` object `my_car` is created with the make "Toyota" and the model "Camry".
2. The `display_info` method is called, which prints the car's make and model.
3. The `start_engine` method is called, printing that the engine is running.
4. The `stop_engine` method is called, printing that the engine is off.

### **Summary**:
- **Methods**: Functions that are defined inside a class to describe the behaviors of objects created from that class. 
- **Instance Variables**: Variables like `@make` and `@model` that store the state (data) of each object.
- **Calling Methods**: You can call a method on an object using the dot notation (`object.method_name`).
